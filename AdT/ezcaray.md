# Medicinal Properties of Beech Tree (*Fagus sylvatica*) - Scientific Evidence Review

## Overview

The European Beech (*Fagus sylvatica* L.) bark has emerged as a subject of scientific research for its bioactive compounds and potential therapeutic applications. This document synthesizes peer-reviewed scientific studies on the medicinal properties of beech bark, focusing on evidence from controlled laboratory experiments and clinical observations.

## Validated Biological Activities

### 1. Antimicrobial Properties

#### Against Gram-Positive Bacteria

**Staphylococcus aureus**

Beech bark extracts demonstrated antibacterial activity against *Staphylococcus aureus* with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 1.56 mg/mL and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 3.12 mg/mL[¹].

A 2022 study confirmed that beech bark extracts showed strong antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive bacteria, including *Cutibacterium acnes*, *Staphylococcus epidermidis*, and methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA)[²].

**MRSA and Other Pathogens**

In a 2025 study testing multiple European tree bark species, beech extract completely inhibited staphylococci growth, demonstrating effectiveness against both standard and methicillin-resistant strains[³].

**Other Bacteria**

Beech bark extracts also showed antibacterial activity against *Escherichia coli*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, and *Salmonella typhimurium* with MIC values of 3 mg/mL and MBC values of 6 mg/mL[¹].

#### Against Fungi

Aqueous beech bark extracts demonstrated antifungal activity against *Candida albicans*, *Candida parapsilosis*, and *Candida zeylanoides*, with MIC values of 25 mg/mL and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of 50 mg/mL[¹].

### 2. Antioxidant Activity

Beech bark extracts exhibited significant free-radical scavenging activity through multiple assays (DPPH, TEAC, and FRAP), with the optimized extract containing 76.49 mg gallic acid equivalents per gram of dry plant material[¹].

A 2025 study found that all tested beech bark extracts significantly reduced oxidative stress in human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT) stressed with cumene hydroperoxide, demonstrating cellular antioxidant capacity relevant to dermatological applications[³].

### 3. Wound Healing Capacity

Beech bark extracts enhanced wound closure in scratch assays using human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT), with all tested concentrations (except the lowest) resulting in over 90% wound closure at 38 hours and complete closure at 48 hours, compared to untreated controls which required 72 hours for complete closure[²].

In the 2025 comparative study, beech extract demonstrated significant wound-healing properties, accelerating artificial wound closure in cell culture models[³].

### 4. Antidiabetic Potential (α-Glucosidase Inhibition)

Beech bark extracts demonstrated α-glucosidase inhibitory activity with IC₅₀ values ranging from 38 to 168 µg/mL depending on extraction solvent, significantly superior to the standard antidiabetic drug acarbose (IC₅₀: 838 µg/mL)[¹].

The inhibition of α-glucosidase enzymes helps regulate blood sugar levels by delaying carbohydrate digestion and glucose absorption in the intestine, making these extracts of interest for diabetes management research.

### 5. Enzyme Inhibition

The ethanol-water (50:50) beech bark extract showed tyrosinase inhibitory activity with 45.99% inhibition at 4.025 mg/mL concentration[¹]. Tyrosinase inhibitors are relevant for cosmetic applications related to skin pigmentation.

## Chemical Composition

### Primary Bioactive Compounds

Scientific analyses have identified numerous phenolic compounds responsible for beech bark's biological activities:

**Polyphenolic Compounds (from optimized extraction)[¹]:**

- **Catechin**: 300.7-577.4 µg/g (highest concentration)
- **Epicatechin**: 22.7-39.6 µg/g
- **Vanillic acid**: 18.0-49.9 µg/g  
- **Protocatechuic acid**: 3.3-6.2 µg/g
- **Syringic acid**: 5.8-24.2 µg/g
- **Gallic acid**: 1.9 µg/g (water extract only)
- **Chlorogenic acid**: Identified in all extracts
- **Ferulic acid**: 43.7 µg/g (quantified)
- **Isoquercitrin**: Identified in all extracts
- **Quercetin**: Identified only in aqueous extract

A 2025 analysis identified vanillic acid and vanillin in notable concentrations in beech bark, along with syringic acid and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid[³].

### Tannin Content

The bark contains tannins that contribute to its astringent properties, though specific quantification varies by extraction method.

## Cellular Safety and Biocompatibility

Beech bark extracts demonstrated no significant cytotoxic effects on human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT) across all tested concentrations, indicating a broad safety margin for potential dermatological applications[³].

Cell viability studies showed that beech extracts at concentrations up to 500 µg/mL maintained cell viability, with cytotoxicity only appearing at very high concentrations (1000 µg/mL)[²].

## Mechanisms of Action

### Antimicrobial Mechanisms

The antimicrobial activity is attributed to multiple mechanisms:

- **Phenolic acids**: Disrupt bacterial cell membranes, inhibit DNA gyrase and protein kinases[²]
- **Flavonoids** (catechin, epicatechin): Penetrate lipid bilayers, disrupt membrane barrier function[²][³]
- **Synergistic effects**: Multiple phenolic compounds working together enhance antibacterial efficacy[²]

### Antioxidant Mechanisms

The antioxidant effects are primarily attributed to catechins and epicatechins, which function as potent ROS scavengers and metal ion chelators, inhibiting lipid peroxidation[¹][³].

### Wound Healing Mechanisms

The ability of beech bark extracts to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation at wound sites creates a more favorable environment for skin regeneration[³].

## Comparative Performance

In a 2025 comprehensive study comparing six European tree bark species (alder, beech, birch, bird cherry, oak, and pine), beech bark displayed moderate efficacy across antimicrobial, antioxidant, and wound-healing assays, though it was outperformed by alder, birch, and oak in most categories[³].

However, beech bark's advantage lies in:
- **Safety profile**: No cytotoxicity at therapeutic concentrations
- **Balanced activity**: Moderate but consistent effects across multiple bioassays
- **Availability**: Abundant forestry byproduct in Europe

## Extraction Optimization

Microwave-assisted extraction using a 50:50 ethanol-water mixture at 300W for 4 minutes yielded the highest total phenolic content (76.57 mg GAE/g dry plant material), representing optimal extraction conditions[¹].

Hot water extraction methods successfully extracted bioactive compounds while maintaining biocompatibility for dermatological applications[²].

## Potential Applications

Based on the scientific evidence, beech bark extracts show promise for:

1. **Dermatological applications**
   - Wound healing preparations
   - Antimicrobial skin treatments
   - Anti-acne formulations (active against *C. acnes*)
   - Antioxidant skin protection

2. **Cosmeceutical products**
   - Anti-aging formulations (antioxidant properties)
   - Skin-lightening products (tyrosinase inhibition)
   - Natural preservatives (antimicrobial activity)

3. **Diabetes management research**
   - Natural α-glucosidase inhibitors
   - Blood sugar regulation supplements

4. **Sustainable utilization**
   - Valorization of forestry waste products
   - Natural alternatives to synthetic antimicrobials

## Research Limitations and Future Directions

### Current Limitations

1. **Primarily in vitro studies**: Most evidence comes from laboratory cell culture and chemical assays
2. **Limited clinical trials**: Human studies are lacking
3. **Antimutagenic effects**: Classified as low to moderate (3.6-17.01% inhibition)[¹]
4. **Variable composition**: Chemical profile depends heavily on extraction method, solvent, and growing conditions

### Recommended Future Research

Future studies should focus on 3D skin models, in vivo animal studies, and clinical trials to validate therapeutic efficacy in real-world conditions[³].

Further research is needed to identify specific compounds responsible for wound-healing acceleration and to elucidate detailed mechanisms of action[²].

## Conclusions

Scientific research has validated several bioactive properties of beech bark extracts:

✓ **Confirmed**: Antimicrobial activity against multiple pathogens including MRSA  
✓ **Confirmed**: Antioxidant capacity through multiple mechanisms  
✓ **Confirmed**: Wound healing acceleration in cell culture models  
✓ **Confirmed**: α-Glucosidase inhibition superior to standard drugs  
✓ **Confirmed**: Safe for human keratinocytes at therapeutic concentrations  

The bark's bioactive compounds—particularly catechins, epicatechins, and various phenolic acids—demonstrate therapeutic potential. Beech bark represents a promising, sustainable source of bioactive compounds from forestry waste, though clinical translation requires additional human studies.

The convergence of traditional use and modern scientific validation suggests beech bark merits continued investigation for pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical applications, particularly in wound care and antimicrobial treatments.

# Medicinal Properties of Cornus sanguinea (Dogwood) - Scientific Evidence Review

## Overview

Cornus sanguinea L., commonly known as common dogwood or red dogwood, is a shrub widely distributed in Europe. Its fruits have been used in traditional medicine and are investigated scientifically for potential therapeutic applications related to metabolic disorders and antioxidant activity.

## Validated Biological Activities

### 1. Digestive Enzyme Inhibition

Cornus sanguinea fruit extracts demonstrated inhibitory activity against key digestive enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism:

#### α-Glucosidase Inhibition

Aqueous-ethanolic extracts from Cornus sanguinea subsp. hungarica fruits showed α-glucosidase inhibitory activity with an IC₅₀ value of 70.07 ± 16.62 μg/mL[¹]. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down complex carbohydrates in the small intestine. While less active than Cornus florida (IC₅₀ = 38.87 ± 2.65 μg/mL), the Cornus sanguinea extract was still significantly more active than the standard antidiabetic drug acarbose (IC₅₀ = 150.43 ± 0.04 μg/mL)[¹].

#### α-Amylase Inhibition

The fruit extract of Cornus sanguinea demonstrated moderate α-amylase inhibitory activity with an IC₅₀ value of 651.44 ± 12.99 μg/mL, placing it between Cornus alba and Cornus florida in terms of potency[¹]. The enzyme α-amylase initiates the breakdown of starch in the digestive tract.

#### Pancreatic Lipase Inhibition

The aqueous-ethanolic extract from Cornus sanguinea fruits showed no significant inhibitory activity against pancreatic lipase in this comparative study[¹].

### 2. Antioxidant Activity

Cornus sanguinea fruit extracts exhibited radical scavenging capacity through the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assay. The aqueous-ethanolic extract showed a SC₅₀ (half-scavenging concentration) value of 130.03 ± 31.61 µg/mL[¹].

While less potent than Cornus florida (SC₅₀ = 17.10 ± 6.89 μg/mL), the antioxidant activity of Cornus sanguinea was comparable to Cornus alba (SC₅₀ = 91.47 ± 3.66 μg/mL), though both were significantly less active than ascorbic acid (SC₅₀ = 3.73 ± 0.83 μg/mL)[¹].

### 3. Phytochemical Composition

#### Total Phenolic Content

The total phenolic content in aqueous-ethanolic extract from Cornus sanguinea subsp. hungarica fruits was 19.72 ± 1.86 mg gallic acid equivalents per gram of extract (mg GAE/g)[¹], which was lower than both Cornus alba (39.60 ± 2.28 mg GAE/g) and Cornus florida (24.30 ± 1.72 mg GAE/g).

#### Identified Bioactive Compounds

HPLC-DAD-MS/MS analysis identified 18 compounds in Cornus sanguinea fruit extract, predominantly belonging to flavonoid and iridoid compound classes[¹]:

**Major Flavonoid Glycosides:**
- Quercetin polyglycosides (quercetin tri-hexosides, di-hexosides, and mono-hexosides)[¹]
- Quercetin 3-O-glucuronide[¹]
- Quercetin 3-O-rhamnoglucoside[¹]
- Myricetin polyglycosides (tri-hexosides and di-hexosides)[¹]
- Isorhamnetin polyglycosides (tri-hexosides)[¹]

**Key Findings:**

The most abundant compounds in Cornus sanguinea fruit extract were quercetin polyglycosides at high levels, indicating the importance of these compounds for the plant's biological activity[¹].

Unlike Cornus alba (which contains significant amounts of phenolic acids and hydrolysable tannins) or Cornus florida (which contains iridoid glucosides), the Cornus sanguinea extract is characterized by its high content of flavonoid glycosides[¹].

### 4. Anthocyanin Content

Cornus sanguinea fruits contain anthocyanins, which are phenolic compounds with demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These compounds include:
- Anthocyanin 3-galactosides
- Anthocyanin 3-glucosides

Cornus species anthocyanins such as delphinidin 3-O-β-galactoside, cyanidin 3-O-β-galactoside, and pelargonidin 3-O-β-galactoside at 40 µM concentration showed significant antioxidant activities of 70.2%, 60.1%, and 40.3%, respectively, in iron-catalyzed liposomal models[¹].

## Comparison with Other Cornus Species

### Relative Biological Activity

Among three Cornus species studied, Cornus alba demonstrated the strongest biological potential, particularly for inhibiting digestive enzymes and pancreatic lipase[¹]. Cornus florida showed the most potent antioxidant activity and α-glucosidase inhibition[¹].

Cornus sanguinea displayed intermediate biological activity:
- **Enzyme Inhibition**: Moderate activity for α-glucosidase and α-amylase, but no significant pancreatic lipase inhibition
- **Antioxidant Activity**: Moderate radical scavenging capacity
- **Phytochemical Profile**: Rich in flavonoid glycosides rather than phenolic acids or iridoids

### Mechanistic Insights

The study concluded that **flavonoids and phenolic acids inhibit digestive enzymes more effectively than iridoid compounds**[¹]. Since Cornus sanguinea contains primarily flavonoid glycosides rather than phenolic acids, its enzyme inhibitory activity is moderate rather than maximal.

However, iridoid compounds or flavonoid glycosides found in fruits of Cornus sanguinea and Cornus florida extracts "do not play a significant role in inhibiting digestive enzymes but exert antioxidant activity,"[¹] suggesting that the antioxidant effects may be mediated by different mechanisms than enzyme inhibition.

## Traditional Uses and Potential Applications

### Ethnobotanical Applications

Cornus sanguinea has been used in traditional European medicine, though less extensively documented than Cornus mas (cornelian cherry). The fruits and bark have been employed for various health-related purposes.

### Potential Therapeutic Applications

Based on the scientific evidence for enzyme inhibition and antioxidant activity, Cornus sanguinea extracts may have potential applications in:

1. **Metabolic Disorder Management**: α-Glucosidase inhibition suggests potential utility in managing postprandial blood glucose levels
2. **Antioxidant Support**: Free radical scavenging activity may help reduce oxidative stress
3. **Obesity Management Research**: While pancreatic lipase inhibition was not observed, the enzyme-inhibitory properties may contribute to lipid metabolism regulation
4. **Food Preservation**: Antioxidant properties could have applications in food industry as natural preservatives

## Research Limitations and Future Directions

### Current Limitations

1. **In vitro Studies Only**: All evidence is from laboratory biochemical assays; human clinical trials are lacking
2. **Fruit Extract Focus**: Most research focuses on fruit extracts; leaves, bark, and other plant parts are less studied
3. **Subspecies Variation**: The study examined Cornus sanguinea subsp. hungarica; other subspecies may have different compositions

### Recommended Future Research

1. **In Vivo Studies**: Animal models testing the ability of Cornus sanguinea extracts to affect postprandial glucose and lipid levels
2. **Clinical Trials**: Human studies to determine therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles
3. **Bioavailability Studies**: Investigation of absorption and metabolism of identified compounds
4. **Leaf and Bark Analysis**: Comparison of bioactive compounds and activities across different plant parts
5. **Subspecies Comparison**: Investigation of phytochemical and biological differences among Cornus sanguinea subspecies

## Conclusions

Scientific investigation has identified moderate but significant bioactive properties in Cornus sanguinea fruit extracts:

✓ **Confirmed**: α-Glucosidase inhibition activity (IC₅₀ = 70.07 ± 16.62 μg/mL)  
✓ **Confirmed**: α-Amylase inhibition activity (IC₅₀ = 651.44 ± 12.99 μg/mL)  
✓ **Confirmed**: Antioxidant/free radical scavenging activity (SC₅₀ = 130.03 ± 31.61 µg/mL)  
✓ **Confirmed**: Rich in flavonoid glycosides and anthocyanins  
✗ **Not Confirmed**: Pancreatic lipase inhibition (no activity observed)  

Cornus sanguinea fruits represent a source of bioactive flavonoid compounds with potential applications in metabolic health. The predominance of flavonoid glycosides in Cornus sanguinea distinguishes it from other Cornus species, particularly in terms of phytochemical profile. However, the moderate enzyme inhibitory activity suggests that while potentially useful, it is less potent than some related species like Cornus alba or Cornus florida.

The convergence of traditional use and scientific validation warrants continued investigation of Cornus sanguinea as a potential functional food ingredient or source of bioactive compounds, particularly for applications targeting glucose and lipid metabolism.

# Medicinal Properties of Quercus faginea (Portuguese Oak)

## Overview

*Quercus faginea* Lam., commonly known as Portuguese oak or gall oak, is a deciduous to semi-evergreen oak species native to the Western Iberian Peninsula and North Africa (Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria)[1]. While traditional medicinal uses have been documented for various Quercus species, specific medicinal applications of *Q. faginea* are primarily related to its rich phytochemical composition.

## Traditional Uses

In traditional medicine from the Aragonese Pyrenees region, *Q. faginea* (locally called "chaparro") has been used in folk remedies for treating hernias in children through ritualistic practices[2]. However, this represents ethnobotanical folklore rather than evidence-based medicine.

## Phytochemical Composition

### Phenolic Compounds and Tannins

*Q. faginea* wood and bark contain significant concentrations of bioactive phenolic compounds:

- **Heartwood**: Contains approximately 558.0 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per gram of extract, with high levels of ellagitannins (168.9 mg tannic acid per gram of extract)[1]
- **Bark**: Shows even higher phenolic content at 630.3 mg GAE per gram of extract, with substantial amounts of condensed tannins (220.7 mg catechin equivalents per gram) and flavonoids (207.7 mg catechin equivalents per gram)[3]

The polyphenolic composition is similar in heartwood and sapwood, characterized by:
- High content of hydrolysable tannins, particularly ellagitannins
- Very low content of condensed tannins
- Phenolic acids including gallic acid and ellagic acid derivatives[1]

### Antioxidant Properties

*Q. faginea* demonstrates exceptional antioxidant activity:

- **Wood extracts**: IC₅₀ values of 2.6 μg/ml (sapwood) and 3.3 μg/ml (heartwood), comparable to the standard antioxidant Trolox (IC₅₀ 3.8 μg/ml)[1]
- **Bark extracts**: IC₅₀ values of 2.25-3.01 μg/ml, demonstrating very high radical scavenging capacity[3]
- **Ferric reducing ability**: Heartwood shows 2.8 mMol Trolox equivalents per gram of extract[1]

### Lipophilic Compounds

The bark lipophilic extracts contain bioactive compounds including[3]:

- **Triterpenes** (17.8% of compounds): friedelin, betulinic acid, betulin, ursolic acid, and lupeol
- **Sterols** (11.5% of compounds): primarily β-sitosterol
- **Fatty acids** (27.8% of compounds): various saturated and unsaturated alkanoic acids

## Potential Medicinal Applications

### Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory Activity

Based on its chemical composition, *Q. faginea* may share therapeutic properties with other Quercus species, which have been used traditionally to treat[4]:

- Asthma
- Hemorrhoids
- Diarrhea
- Gastric ulcers
- Wound healing

The high concentrations of ellagitannins and phenolic compounds provide strong antioxidant capacity that could contribute to these therapeutic effects[1][3].

### Bioactive Potential

The triterpenes found in *Q. faginea* bark, particularly:
- **Betulinic acid**: Known for anti-inflammatory and potential antitumor properties
- **Ursolic acid**: Recognized for anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities
- **β-sitosterol**: Associated with cholesterol-lowering effects

These compounds suggest potential pharmaceutical applications, though specific clinical studies on *Q. faginea* are lacking[3].

## Research Status

While *Q. faginea* shows promising phytochemical profiles comparable to other medicinal oak species, direct clinical research on its medicinal properties remains limited. Most evidence is extrapolated from:

1. Chemical composition studies
2. In vitro antioxidant assays
3. Traditional use patterns of related Quercus species

The species has primarily been studied for its potential in cooperage (barrel-making) and as a source of natural antioxidants for food and cosmetic applications rather than for direct pharmaceutical use[1][3].

## Safety and Considerations

No specific toxicity studies or safety profiles for *Q. faginea* medicinal preparations have been published in peer-reviewed literature. As with other oak species, preparations containing high tannin concentrations should be used cautiously due to potential astringent effects and interactions with iron absorption.
