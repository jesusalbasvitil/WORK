*Recent investigation into the visual field of the African Whitebacked Vulture Gyps africanus and Eurasian Griffon has shown these vultures to have a considerable field of vision, with a maximum 22-degree total binocular sector when the head is held in the horizontal plane. However, when the head is tilted forward, whilst foraging, a considerable blind sector is formed above and behind, as well as a forward blind sector suggesting that this may contribute towards collision vulnerability in these species. Vultures also appear to possess a considerable backward blind sector of around 70 degrees (or more) in the horizontal plane (Martin et al. 2012)*
